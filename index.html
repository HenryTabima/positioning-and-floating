          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
          physics.
          <br><br>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big
          Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
          the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          <br>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
          jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
          not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          <br>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
          <br>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
          that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          <br>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
          astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
          space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
          roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          <br>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
          ever be proved.
          <br>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
          pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
          and speculation.
          <br>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
          eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>
        <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
        <p>
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of
          particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
          observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
          space-time.
          <br>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is
          huge, as big as it gets.”
          <br>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          <br>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and
          preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
          <br>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
          Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set
          of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

        <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
        <span>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
        uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</span>
